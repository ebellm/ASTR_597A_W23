Many hands-on activities in this course will make use of the Rubin Science Platform (RSP).

To get an account, you'll need to sign up as a "Data Preview 0 Delegate."  Please follow the instructions `here <https://community.lsst.org/t/invitation-to-become-a-dp0-delegate-and-prepare-for-lsst-science/7207>`_.

.. note::
   You do not need to request DP0 Delegate access if you are already involved in Rubin construction or commissioning projects (e.g., the individuals listed on `this page <https://sitcomtn-050.lsst.io/#institutional-contributions-to-rubin-observatory-construction>`_).  If you can log in to `data.lsst.cloud <https://data.lsst.cloud/>`_ you do not need to fill out the form.
