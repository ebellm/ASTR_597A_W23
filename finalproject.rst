For the final project you may choose to write one of two papers:

Proposal for Early Science with LSST
====================================

The first final project option is meant to encourage you to think practically about how to make discoveries with LSST.  Choose a scientific question you are interested in and that could be addressed with early LSST data.  Identify what you would need to complete a paper on this topic, and write a proposal of up to 5 pages for that resource.  Do you need followup observations?  Write an observing proposal for an appropriate telescope.  Do you need computational resources?  Write a proposal for a computing facility.  Do you just need time for focused work on this topic?  Write a proposal for funding (e.g., a prize postdoctoral fellowship or NSF proposal).

Like a real proposal, your proposal should convince the reader that the question you're answering is scientifically important and include enough quantitative analysis to justify the resources being requested.  You can use whatever format you like, but you will be asked to identify a concrete proposal call that your proposal could be submitted to.



Short ApJ Letter-style paper analyzing DP0.2 data
=================================================

This final project option focuses on scientific data analysis.  Identify an interesting topic that could be addressed with DP0.2 data, perform the analysis, and write a short (~5 page) journal-style paper describing the results.
Your paper need not be "ready for submission," but it should be plausibly publishable with further polishing.

Peer Review
===========

While your instructors will grade your final projects, for your final homework you will be asked to peer review/referee a subset of your classmates' projects.
Your feedback won't affect their scores, but we will grade your review comments for helpfulness and appropriateness.

Final Presentations
===================

For our last class meeting we will have short, ungraded summary presentations of the final projects.
